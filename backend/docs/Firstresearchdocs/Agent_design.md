# **PROJECT PROMPT: SynBot Evolution → Departmental Intelligence & Workflow Automation Architecture**

## Objective

Transform SynBot from a tool-calling KPI assistant into a **structured, department-scoped intelligence system** that:

* Enhances Royan Hospital's clinical operations workflow
* Introduces domain-based Analyst Agents
* Implements closed-loop workflow automations
* Reduces DB inefficiencies via batched intelligence execution
* Preserves governance, auditability, and role-based boundaries
* Remains deterministic, scalable, and enterprise-safe

This is not an autonomous AI system.
This is a controlled intelligence upgrade.

---

# 1️⃣ Business Context (Operational Grounding)

Royan Hospital is a **regulated healthcare provider** serving patients in Nigeria.

Core operational flow:

1. Port Clearing
2. Delivery to Warehouse (Anti-room)
3. Inventory + Quality Control (QC)
4. Cold Room Storage
5. NAFDAC Sampling & Regulatory Release
6. Invoicing (Based on Purchase Orders)
7. Packaging (Validated Temperature-Controlled Systems)
8. Delivery to Hospitals / Pharmacies / Patients

Key characteristics:

* High regulatory oversight (NAFDAC)
* Cold-chain dependency
* Batch & expiry tracking required
* PO-based B2B invoicing
* AR exposure risk
* Multi-stage inventory lifecycle
* Compliance-sensitive operations

The system must reflect and strengthen this workflow.

---

# 2️⃣ Architectural Upgrade Overview

Current Model:

```
Chat → Tool → DB Query → Compute → Return
```

New Model:

```
Chat → Domain Agent → Batch Fetch → Analyze → Structured Insight Object → Cache → Return
```

Agents must:

* Be domain-scoped
* Batch-fetch data
* Compute grouped metrics
* Produce structured outputs
* Write to TTL cache
* Be fully logged and auditable

No uncontrolled autonomy.
No self-triggering loops.
No agent spawning.

---

# 3️⃣ Core Architectural Additions

## A. Agent Framework Layer

Create `/agents/` directory.

### BaseAgent Interface

Each agent must implement:

* `collect_data()`
* `analyze()`
* `generate_insights()`
* `write_cache()`
* `get_output_schema()`

All agents return:

### Standard Insight Object

```
{
  metrics: {},
  findings: [],
  risks: [],
  recommendations: [],
  confidence_score: float,
  supporting_refs: [],
  execution_metadata: {
    query_count,
    latency,
    timestamp
  }
}
```

---

## B. Agent Registry

Create `agent_registry.py`.

Map:

* Agent Name
* Domain
* Required Role
* Trigger Context

Chat orchestration must call agents via registry.

---

## C. Batch Query Utility

Implement domain-level batch data fetch:

Instead of multiple DB calls per KPI:

Each agent:

* Performs grouped multi-table fetch
* Aggregates internally
* Writes summary to cache

Maintain TTL caching.

---

# 4️⃣ Departmental Agent Implementation

---

## 1. Import & Clearance Agent

Purpose:
Monitor shipment lifecycle and supplier performance.

Required Features:

* Shipment status tracking
* Clearance duration monitoring
* Delay threshold alerts
* Supplier reliability scorecard

Workflow Additions:
Shipment States:

* In Transit
* At Port
* Under Clearance
* Released
* Delivered

If clearance exceeds threshold:
→ Escalation log
→ Executive alert

---

## 2. Inventory Intelligence Agent

Purpose:
Closed-loop stock and batch lifecycle management.

Features:

### Low Stock Automation

If stock < threshold:
→ Auto-create Replenishment Recommendation
→ Add to Procurement Request Queue

When stock received:
→ Mark received
→ Update batch & expiry
→ Auto-clear alert

### Expiry Monitoring

If expiry < 60 days:
→ Flag risk
→ Recommend sales promotion or redistribution

### Cold Room Capacity

If storage > 85%:
→ Risk alert
→ Suggest redistribution

---

## 3. Compliance Monitoring Agent

Purpose:
Digitize regulatory enforcement logic.

Features:

* NAFDAC sampling status tracking
* Batch-level compliance states
* Lock invoice issuance for non-approved stock
* Audit export generation

If batch pending approval:
→ Prevent dispatch
→ Prevent invoice

Auto-release upon approval.

---

## 4. Cold-Chain Integrity Agent

Purpose:
Preserve temperature compliance across storage and dispatch.

Features:

* Temperature deviation logging
* Delivery box validation logging
* Van compliance tracking

If temperature breach:
→ Flag batch
→ Lock inventory
→ Notify QC

---

## 5. Logistics Optimization Agent

Purpose:
Improve delivery performance and SLA tracking.

Features:

* Dispatch lifecycle states
* Delivery delay detection
* SLA breach logging
* Route performance insights

If delay > threshold:
→ Notify operations
→ Log SLA breach
→ Feed Risk Agent

---

## 6. Financial Analyst Agent

Purpose:
Protect margin and credit exposure.

Features:

* AR aging risk scoring
* Product-line profitability
* Margin compression detection
* Currency impact simulation

If customer overdue > X days:
→ Flag credit risk
→ Reduce credit limit
→ Executive alert

---

## 7. Revenue Strategy Agent

Purpose:
Strategic growth planning.

Features:

* Accept growth goal input (e.g., +15% revenue)
* Decompose by:

  * Product mix
  * Pricing
  * Customer expansion
* Scenario simulation
* Weekly experiment proposals

Output:
Actionable growth roadmap.

---

## 8. Enterprise Risk Agent

Purpose:
Cross-domain risk consolidation.

Inputs:

* Regulatory signals
* Inventory pressure
* Financial exposure
* Logistics delays

Outputs:

* Risk heatmap
* Scenario projections
* Mitigation strategies

---

## 9. Business Process Optimization Agent

Purpose:
Detect workflow bottlenecks.

Monitors:

* Clearance duration
* Anti-room processing time
* Dispatch turnaround
* Invoice-to-payment cycle

Outputs:

* Bottleneck detection
* Process improvement suggestions

---

# 5️⃣ Workflow Automation Requirements

These must exist beyond agent analysis.

---

### Replenishment Lifecycle

Low stock → Request → Approval → PO → Delivery → Mark Received → Alert cleared

---

### Batch Compliance Lock

Pending approval → Cannot invoice → Auto-release upon approval

---

### Delivery Chain-of-Custody

Dispatch → Assign vehicle → Attach temp log → Delivery confirmation → Signed proof

---

### Credit Risk Enforcement

Overdue AR → Risk flag → Credit adjustment → Executive notification

---

### Expiry Prevention

Near expiry → Sales trigger → Redistribution suggestion

---

# 6️⃣ Executive Chat Upgrade

Chat must:

* Identify intent domain
* Route to relevant agent
* Merge multi-agent responses if cross-domain
* Summarize structured insight
* Display evidence references
* Maintain role boundaries

Replace granular tool planning for domain analytics.

---

# 7️⃣ Governance & Observability

Mandatory:

* Agent execution logs
* Query count tracking
* Cache hit/miss metrics
* Latency monitoring
* Role-based access enforcement
* Audit trail for all workflow state changes

---

## Milestone 6

we'll add a calendar feature manager  and a task manager/to do list tracker for executives dashboards and staff, where all members can see what the companies calender looks like, majot events are tracked, meetings are schduled, yunno, like a teams features, but only the essentials.The task managers, should all for adding basic personal tasks for staff and for executive, a reminder and pop up feature - e.g a major/minor event pops ups, inventory restock, regulation meeting, the executive have the ability to add it to the list of tasks only enabled for the execuitves mode, even the executive chat mode, has the ability to call and use this new agents/ managers, when needed.

## milestone 7
Add the floating chat icon on all pages, but level of access to function tools, depending on the Rbac, designed when the admin creates a new user.

# 9️⃣ Success Criteria

# Final Vision

SynBot evolves into:

A structured digital operations & strategy intelligence layer
